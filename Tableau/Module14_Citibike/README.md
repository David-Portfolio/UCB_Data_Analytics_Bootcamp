# Bike-sharing Review & Expansion Proposal

  The purpose of this project is to review the bike-sharing program for New York City, and explore a proposal to expand a similar bike-sharing program to the city of Des Moines in Iowa. In the analysis, we have compared the most recent key population and land statistics reported by the United States Census Bureau. As referenced, New York City's population per square mile is significantly denser than that of Des Moines, at 27,013 and 2,516 respectively. The number of firms is also greater in New York City at 1,050,911 compared to Des Moines at 16,543. Thus, we can infer that traffic along the roads of New York City are highly congested. Reviewing the August 2019 citibike data for New York City, these trends are observed:

* The distances traveled are within a general radius as shown in the start/end location maps. They are also close to McD locations.
* The number of bike trips increase during the early mornings, decrease and climbs back up throughout the day, peaking in the evening.
* The trip duration is highest in the evening.
* Majority of the citibikers are subscribers of the program.

  Due to the heavy traffic in New York City, the citibike has become a solution for people to avoid the long commute times of driving or cab/rideshare. The average travel time to work for workers age 16 years+ is 41.2 minutes. The city's density is a major factor in this and thus the program has a higher subscription of recurring customers. New York City being a major tourist destination, travelers are also customers of citibike.
  
  While the city make-up of Des Moines is not the same as New York City, there is a strong case for expansion from the data. Being less dense (comparing the proximities to McD's in both cities) with shorter work commute times (19 minutes on average), individuals choosing to bike would be doing so not only to avoid commute times, but also enjoy the exercise in a scenic ride. As the capital of the most populous city in Iowa and business base for insurance, financial services and publishing companies (source: wikipedia), there will be a similar mixture of locals, business travelers, and tourists, making it an attractive expansion opportunity. This will open up the market for both subscribers and customers of citibikie as seen with New York City.
