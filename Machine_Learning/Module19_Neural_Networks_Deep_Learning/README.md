The purpose of this project is to use machine learning techniques to support future funding decisions by Alphabet Soup. Our data source provides over 34,000 organizations that have previously received funding. After pre-processing the data, we run our model.

* Layer 1: 100 neurons, activation = "relu"
* Layer 2: 50 neurons, activation = "relu"
* Layer 3: 1 neurons, activation = "sigmoid"
