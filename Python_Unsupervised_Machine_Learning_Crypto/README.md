The purpose of this project is to analyze cryptocurrencies in the trading market. The goal is to see how they can potentially be grouped towards creating a classification for a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio. Given that there is no known output for the analysis, unsupervised learning is used to discover unknown patterns from the cryptocurrency data. The findings are displayed in scatter plots and data tables.
